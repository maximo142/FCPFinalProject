argparse needs to be setup and flags created - NOT done


selector function picks random individual from 0 - 1000 and either neighbour to their left or right - DONE
class updates their opinions - DONE

for loop needs to pick random person many many times and apply in the following order:
selector 
update opinion - returns new values and the index values for each new opnion value
for loop then applies info from 'update opinion' replacing the old values in the array
... process repeats

all DONE

need to work out how to graph all of this as well but cross that bridge when we get to it - NOT done
